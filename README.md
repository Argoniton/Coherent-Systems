# Coherent Systems

_A new wave of automatization brings unlimited possibilities to improve our lives

Literally, all electronic devices could be interconnected and work in sync_

## I can make things work!

To begin with, when I studied at school I acquired practical experience working with microcontrollers. Despite having electronic devices for years, I was genuinely excited/fervent/impassioned/ardent/passionate/enthusiastic about making small e-stuff work. I purchased a handful of microcontrollers, lights, and one programming  module - a device to upload an application from a laptop on a controller. Then I began to write my applications in developer tool and run them on a controller. My apps were relatively simple, consisting of a few lines, they could make lights blink how I wanted which looked adorable. By that time I switched my focus towards creating a new developer panel. Since I didn’t have enough proficiency in constructing actual e-schemes, it consumed too much time, so shortly after I had to renounce my project. However I still have a strong interest and attentiveness in amazing stuff we can implement, to name just a few: gradual change of visible intensiveness of light by manipulating with on and off periods, connecting wireless modules like WiFi or Bluetooth and operating with a scheme from a device like phone, reading measures from apparatuses and using retrieved data to control. I have enough knowledge and experience to implement things which will make life easier and enjoyable.

## Internet of Things—ever growing industry

First of all, with the release of new versions of iOS and Android, it becomes apparent what direction technological industry is oriented. Primarily, an accent is placed upon exterior devices such as watches, house equipment, and even cars. People want to operate stuff indirectly from a handy device like a phone.

Furthermore, the market begins to adapt to people’s needs. I predict that all substantial tools are going to have some kind of wireless connection either to directly control (like washing machine and oven) or retrieve some measures (like water and electricity counters). Wouldn’t that be easier to equip a house or a factory with such devices? Just notice how big corporations are desperate to set up Internet-of-Things laboratories.

Finally, more and more people learn to program. With proper tools anyone produces and programs devices that will make life around more enjoyable and happy, we would forget about daunting routine and spend more resources and time on things that actually matter.
In conclusion, I plan to found a company—Coherent Systems. The first step I will take is to tell my friends about it and create a page github.com/Argoniton/Coherent-System.
